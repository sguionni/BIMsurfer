	<h1>[EXPERIMENTAL] BIMsurfer 3 Index Page</h1>
	<p>This page serves as an index page to jump to different example/development/testing applications of BIMsurfer V3</p>
	<b>To be clear, BIMsurfer 3 is a JavaScript library, not an application, what you see here can be regarded as documentation</b>

				Includes UI to select project, visual settings and stats<br/><br/>
				When BIMsurfer 3 is loaded from a BIMserver, it will try to connect to it's API, otherwise, it will connect to http://localhost:8080<br/><br/>
				First time you'll have to login with credentials valid on your BIMserver, after that those will be stored in localStorage<br/><br/>
				Be advised that not all combinations of all settings will result in something that works
